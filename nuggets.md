General Coding Tips / Tricks / Things to Remember
----------------
- TDD code is easier to understand by future developers. There is a timeline of unit tests with intuitive names.
- Pomodoro timer is really useful. Pin it to your browser and set it up to your tastes. Mine is 25 mins on, 5 mins break.
- On MacOS holding down CMD + / will comment out all that is highlighted in Vscode.
- Don't copy + paste code, try to rewrite it, and play around with it using your own parameters or variables.
