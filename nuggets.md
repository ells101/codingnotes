General Coding Tips / Tricks / Things to Remember
--------------
- TDD code is easier to understand by future developers. There is a timeline of unit tests with intuitive names.
- Pomodoro timer is really useful. Pin it to your browser and set it up to your tastes. Mine is 25 mins on, 5 mins break.
- On MacOS holding down CMD + / will comment out all that is highlighted in Vscode.
- Don't copy + paste code, try to rewrite it, and play around with it using your own parameters or variables.
- Having trouble reading long bits of HTML? Use HTML formatter to make ugly HTML readable.
- Shift + Enter is the shortcut to run your code.
- Finding an exercise/kata you like and trying to do it every day for a week is a great way to put something into long-term memory.
- Find a mentor. Use meetamentor.co.uk to find one. It's free!
- Immerse yourself in the programming world. You can follow podcasts and mailing lists for Open Source projects to get a feel for how Devs communicate with each other.
- Better comments is a great way of organising comments. Use # and then enter symnbol: *(important), !(high importance/warning), ?(Questions), *TODO
@ (to denote params)
- Breaking something complex and large into smaller bits with methods is called *method decomposition*.
