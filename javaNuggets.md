Java Tips
--------------
- In java, all code is written within classes. Our program needs to have *at least one* class. e.g in java.hello the class is `Hello`. 
- Unlike Javascript or Ruby, a Java file needs first to be compiled to an executable program. e.g
in the hello java example, Hello.class is added to the folder after calling javac. This file is the compiled version of the Java source file. 
- When using printf and %f (float) format specifier, to trim trailing zero's simply write: %.1f (for 1 zero) %.2f (for two zeros) etc etc...
- "void" in public static void main (function declaration) means nothing is expected to be returned in the function. The return result will be
nothing, i.e void.
