Ruby Coding Tips / Tricks / Things to Remember
==============================================

- Implicit "return" so you don't need to write "return" you can just write the variable.
- You can chain methods by adding methods to an "end" statement. Looks quite weird, but also slick :)

Handy In-Build Methods
-----------------------

- .max method can ensure that the result of a calculation will cap at a specified number

>e.g. [var1 - var2, 0].max ensures that after subtracting var1 from var2, the highest result will be 0. Ensuring no negative numbers
