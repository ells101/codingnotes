- pyTest TDD: Assert is used to compare an observed value with an expected one to check if they're the same. Proceeds only if expression is true. Raises an Assertionerror when it is false. Mostly used for logical expressions.
- Lambdas are handy for producing functions that you don't want as a declared variable, so it's only used for a short amount of time. (Lambda = anonymous function)
