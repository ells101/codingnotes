# Coding Notes - Tips/Tricks/Oddities

On my way to becomming a software developer I've journalled tips I find quirky in some way. Sometimes the tips aren't about coding itself, but the way in which we code or work as a team.

Many of these unusual tips come from my time at the Makers Web Development bootcamp. Others have come from videos or online tutorials.

Specific tips in relation to programming languages or frameworks are split up for ease of use.

Enjoy and I hope you learn something.
